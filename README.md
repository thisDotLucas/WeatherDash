# Weather Dash
---
Weather Dash is a graphical user interface that graphs temperature and humidity data from the OpenWeatherMap API and compares it to an arduino sensor.

#### Note
 Data is available from june 2019.
The suprisingly big difference in temperatures is caused by the sensor being located on a balcony surronded by glass panels. Our sensor has had problems with humidity since November.
