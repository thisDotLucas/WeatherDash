# Weather Dash
---
Weather Dash is a graphical user interface that graphs temperature and humidity data from the OpenWeatherMap API and compares it to an arduino sensor.

#### Note
The abot 3-6 Celsisus difference in temperatures is caused by the sensor being located on a balcony surronded by glass panels.
